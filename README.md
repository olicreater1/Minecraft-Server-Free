# Free Minecraft Server
This is a program that runs on linux, i personally use oracle cloud, but anything can be used in this case. 

# Steps
1. Install this file through wget or sftp
2. Give execute permessions if necessary with "chmod u+x LinuxServerInstall.sh"
3. Run it by doing ./LinuxServerInstall.sh
4. Wait for run script to be created, then run it by doing ./Run.sh
5. Play your server by typing in the ip adress of the hosting server
# Trouble Shooting
If you never set up a server before you may need to forward the minecraft port to make it work
